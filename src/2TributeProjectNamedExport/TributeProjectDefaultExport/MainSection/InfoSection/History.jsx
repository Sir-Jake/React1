        Ken Block was a visionary entrepreneur and athlete who transitioned from
        the business world to the driver’s seat later in life. In 1994, he
        co-founded DC Shoes, a brand that became synonymous with action sports
        culture. After selling his stake in 2004, he pivoted to professional
        rallying at the age of 37. Starting his career with a Subaru WRX STI, he
        quickly proved his natural talent by winning the Rally America Rookie of
        the Year in 2005. This early success led to a long-standing partnership
        with Subaru and later Ford, establishing him as a powerhouse in American
        stage rally and the X Games.

        Block’s global fame reached its peak
        through his legendary Gymkhana video series, which redefined automotive
        entertainment with high-production, precision-stunt driving. He
        eventually founded the Hoonigan Racing Division, using his marketing
        genius to bridge the gap between professional motorsport and
        street-level car culture. As the first American to campaign in the World
        Rally Championship (WRC) and a creator of iconic builds like the 1,400hp
        "Hoonicorn," Block left an indelible mark on the industry. He passed
        away in early 2023, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire
        enthusiasts and "Hashiriya" alike.
